**Focus:** Choosing Embedding Models (for different use cases)

## 🧠 What I Learned
- general-purpose retrieval models
- Text Embeddings are vector representations of text that encode semantic information.
- Embedding is not just for text, they can be applied to images, audio, or even graph data. In a general sense, embedding is the process of converting data [of any type] into vectors.


⚠️ Speed-Bump / Question
- Why embbeding search seems so fast compare to traditional search?
