**Focus:** LLM basic

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Tokenization
    - Tokenization means breaking text into smaller pieces called tokens.
    - Limitations of Word Tokenization
      1. Large memory space required as each word has a number
      2. Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words
      3. inefficient becase words have Morphology
        e.g.: "run," "running," "runs," and "ran" are all related, but a simple word tokenizer views them as four separate, unrelated tokens. 

## 💻 Snippet / Command
```py
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")
tokens = enc.encode("ChatGPT is great!")
print(tokens)           # [36781, 318, 374, 0... etc.]
print(len(tokens))
outputs:  
[16047, 38, 2898, 374, 2294, 0]
6
```
