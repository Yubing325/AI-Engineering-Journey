# 🧠 AI Journey — From Software Developer to Machine Learning & AI Agent Engineer

This repository documents my personal journey transitioning from a **Software Developer** into a **Machine Learning / AI Agent Engineer**.  
It’s not just notes — it’s a public build-in-public record of learning, experiments, and reflections meant to help others take a similar path.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
To build, learn, and share consistently:
- Turn daily notes into weekly public artifacts.
- Capture projects, experiments, and lessons.
- Create reference material that compounds over time.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
/logs         → short daily “TIL” (Today I Learned) notes
/weeklies     → weekly write-ups, experiments, or learnings
/projects     → AI/ML/Agent project code and design notes
/assets       → screenshots, diagrams, images
/ideas        → backlog of topics, projects, or post ideas
/checklists   → reusable templates and definitions of done

---

## 🧩 Templates Included
| Template | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `daily_log_template.md` | For quick 15-minute daily logs |
| `weekly_post_template.md` | For weekly deep-dives or write-ups |
| `monthly_recap_template.md` | For structured monthly reflections |

---

## 📜 Core Principles
1. **Ship something weekly** — done is better than perfect.  
2. **Keep it small** — each artifact ≤ 90 minutes of effort.  
3. **Public by default** — transparency beats polish.  
4. **Templates > willpower** — use the pre-made checklists.  
5. **Sunday reflection** — pause, review, and plan next week.  

---

## 🗓️ Workflow Overview
**Daily (15 min)** → Add one log to `/logs`  
**Weekly (60–90 min)** → Publish one write-up in `/weeklies`  
**Monthly (2–3 h)** → Summarize progress in `/monthly_recap`

---

## 🧰 Tech Context
This journey parallels hands-on learning in:
- Python + ML (scikit-learn, PyTorch, LangChain)
- .NET Web API for AI orchestration
- LLMs, RAG systems, and multi-agent architectures
- MLOps & distributed system fundamentals

---

## 🧭 Mission Statement
> **Learn publicly. Build continuously. Inspire transparently.**

Every log, post, or project is a small step toward mastery — and a breadcrumb for the next engineer following the same path.
